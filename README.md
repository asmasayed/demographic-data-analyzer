# Demographic Data Analysis

This project is part of the **FreeCodeCamp Data Science Certification**. It is **Project 2 of 5** required projects for the course: *Data Analysis with Python*.  

In this challenge, I analyzed a dataset extracted from the **1994 Census database** to answer key demographic questions using **Pandas**.

The analysis involved answering questions such as:

- Number of people of each race  
- Average age of men  
- Percentage of people with a Bachelor's degree  
- Salary statistics for advanced vs. non-advanced education groups  
- Minimum number of working hours per week and related salary insights  
- Country with the highest percentage of people earning >50K  
- Most popular occupation for high earners in India

## Skills & Tools Learned
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data manipulation and analysis  
- Conditional filtering, grouping, and aggregation in Pandas  
- Calculating percentages and averages from data  
- Identifying trends and patterns in demographic data

## Project Outcome
Working on this project helped me:

- Strengthen my **data analysis skills using Pandas**  
- Understand demographic trends and advanced filtering techniques  
- Gain confidence to tackle **more complex projects** in the FreeCodeCamp Data Science course
